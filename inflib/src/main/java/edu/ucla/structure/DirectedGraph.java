/**
* The interface describing directed graphs. Any object may be a vertex. Following
* the convention of the Collection interface, some operations are optional. In this case
* the modification methods are all optional allowing for mutable or immutable graphs. Typically
* the definition of a directed graph requires a non-empty set of vertices. We will slightly abuse the
* term by allowing empty directed graphs(graphs with no vertices). This is done in order to simplify
* incremental creation and destruction of the graph, as well as to conform to the conventions
* of the Collection interface.
* The inspiration for this interface comes from the book Structures in Java. In many respects
* the implementation is similar.
*
* Passing an Object that is not a vertex when a vertex is called for is considered bad
* form, so behavior may vary from implementation to implementation.
