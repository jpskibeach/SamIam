Important: The scripts here refer to a script called "mypaths"
which is not here.  ( Windows - mypaths.bat, Unix - mypaths.csh ).

You can find a template version of mypaths.bat or mypaths.csh in
the root directory of the samiam module, called mypaths.template.bat
and mypaths.template.csh

(1) Create your own script based on the template script by
	filling in the missing values.

(2) Make your script available to the scripts here:
	(2.1) Windows - You can create a single mypaths.bat and
		put it in a folder that occurs in your path.
	(2.2) Unix - You can create a single mypaths.csh and then
		create symbolic links to it in the directories
		where you need it.
